1. Check if there is a physical button or key combination on your laptop that can disable the touchpad. Some laptops have a dedicated button above the touchpad or a key combination like Fn + F6.

2. If there is no physical button or key combination, you can try disabling the touchpad through the system settings. Here's how you can do it on Ubuntu:

   - Go to the ""Settings"" by clicking on Activities and typing ""Settings"" in the search bar.
   - Click on ""Devices"" and then on ""Mouse & Touchpad"".
   - You should see an option to toggle the touchpad on or off. Make sure it is set to off.

3. If you still can't turn off the touchpad, you can try installing the `xinput` utility to disable the touchpad. Open a terminal and type the following commands:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install xinput
   xinput list
   ```

   - Look for the entry corresponding to your touchpad and note the ID number.
   - Use the following command to disable the touchpad (replace [id] with the ID number of your touchpad):

   ```
   xinput set-prop [id] ""Device Enabled"" 0
   ```

   - To re-enable the touchpad, use the following command:

   ```
   xinput set-prop [id] ""Device Enabled"" 1
   ```

These steps should help you to troubleshoot and turn off the touchpad on your Lenovo laptop."
1,how do i use ls to list all files in 'my music' with the extension of wma? (there are multiple directories in my music,ls -r | grep wma is one way. :),"You can use the `find` command along with the `ls -R` command in this way:

```bash
find /path/to/my/music -name '*.wma'
```

This command will list all files with the extension '.wma' in the 'my music' directory and all its subdirectories.","To use the `ls` command to list all files in the ""my music"" directory and its subdirectories with the .wma extension, you can use the following command:

```bash
ls -R my\ music/*.wma
```

In this command:
- `ls` is the command to list directory contents.
- `-R` is an option that tells `ls` to recursively list subdirectories.
- `my\ music/*.wma` is the path to the directory ""my music"" and specifies to list only files with the .wma extension.

This command will list all files with the .wma extension in the ""my music"" directory and its subdirectories."
2,how can i make ubuntu start in text/command line mode only at each system start (i think it's called runlevel 2)?,"ubuntu (like debian) doesn't use runlevels (they're all the same), what you'll want to do is stop gdm from starting at boot.","I suggest you make the following changes to your Ubuntu system:

1. Open a terminal by pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`.
2. Run the command `sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target`.

4,need help booting from windows partition after copying it from bad hard drive ubuntu boots fine but can't get windows to load after grub finds it,"er, my bad ... use bootcfg. use the /scan then /rebuild switches. if that doesn't work, do a fixboot /mbr, then reinstall grub.","Sure! You need to manually update the GRUB configuration file to add an entry for the Windows boot loader. Here's how you can do it in Ubuntu:

1. Boot into Ubuntu.
2. Open a terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
3. Run the command `sudo update-grub`. This will update the GRUB configuration file to include entries for all detected operating systems.

Let me know if you need further assistance with that.","If you have successfully copied the Windows partition from the bad hard drive to a new drive and Ubuntu is booting fine, but you are unable to boot into Windows, you can try the following steps to try and fix the issue:

1. Use Boot Repair: Run Boot Repair on your Ubuntu system. Boot Repair is a tool that can fix most of the common bootloader issues. You can install Boot Repair by running the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt update
sudo apt install boot-repair
```

After installing Boot Repair, launch it from the Applications menu and follow the on-screen instructions to repair the bootloader.

2. Verify Boot Order: Check the BIOS boot order settings to ensure that the drive containing the Windows partition is set as the primary boot device. You may need to set the Windows drive higher in the boot order than the Ubuntu drive.

3. Use Windows Repair: If Boot Repair does not fix the issue, you can try using the Windows installation media to repair the Windows bootloader. Boot from the Windows installation media and choose the repair option. You can then use the command prompt to repair the Windows bootloader using commands like `bootrec /fixmbr` and `bootrec /fixboot`.

4. Reinstall Windows Bootloader: If none of the above steps work, you can try reinstalling the Windows bootloader from scratch. Boot from the Windows installation media and choose the Command Prompt option. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
bootrec /fixmbr
bootrec /rebuildbcd
```

These commands will rebuild the Windows bootloader and hopefully fix the issue.

Remember to back up your data before attempting any of the above steps. If you are not comfortable with these technical steps, it may be best to seek help from a professional or someone with more experience in system repair."

6,is there anyway to have the software update tool use a different set of repositories than synaptic or apt-get,i've not seen one.,"Yes! You can specify different repositories for the Software Update tool (also known as ""Software Updater"" or ""Update Manager"") by editing the sources.list file. This file is located in the /etc/apt/ directory.

Here are the steps to edit the sources.list file:

1. Open a terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
2. Type the following command to open the sources.list file in a text editor (you will need superuser privileges to edit this file):
```
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
3. Here you can add or remove repositories by following the same format as the existing lines in the file. Make sure to save the changes before exiting the editor.
4. After editing the sources.list file, you can update the package lists by running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
5. Now, the Software Updater tool will use the repositories specified in the sources.list file for checking and installing updates.

Remember that editing the sources.list file requires some knowledge about repositories and their configurations. Make sure to use caution and double-check the changes before saving the file.","Yes, you can configure different repositories for the Software Update tool compared to Synaptic or apt-get. 

The Software & Updates application in Ubuntu allows you to manage software repositories and sources. You can open Software & Updates by searching for it in the application menu or by running the command `software-properties-gtk` in the terminal.

Within Software & Updates, go to the ""Other Software"" tab. Here you can add or remove repositories specifically for the Software Update tool. Each checked repository will be considered for updates by the Software Update tool.

This way, you can customize the repositories used by the Software Update tool independently of the repositories used by Synaptic or apt-get."
7,how can i make karmic use the notify-osd for volume like jaunty did without using pulseaudio?,open synaptic and then file → history,"I'm not sure if it is feasible to achieve this behavior without using PulseAudio, as Notify OSD is closely tied to PulseAudio in Ubuntu. Notify OSD was introduced in Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and has been integrated with PulseAudio for system notifications. 
If you don't want to use PulseAudio, you might have to look for alternative notification solutions such as Dunst or other notification daemons.","To make Karmic use the notify-osd for volume like Jaunty did without using PulseAudio, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the `osd-notify` package:
```bash
sudo apt-get install osd-notify
```

2. Edit the `/usr/share/gnome/autostart/volumeicon.desktop` file:
```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/gnome/autostart/volumeicon.desktop
```

3. Comment out the `volumeicon` command and add the following command instead:
```bash
Exec=osd-notify /usr/share/sounds/gdk/about.wav
```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. Reboot your system or log out and log back in to apply the changes.

After following these steps, your system should now use `osd-notify` for volume notifications without using PulseAudio."

9,~how would i safely remove distfiles (/var/cache/apt/archives),sudo apt-get clean,"It is not recommended to manually delete files from the /var/cache/apt/archives directory because the files in that directory are the packages that you have downloaded and installed on your system through APT (Advanced Packaging Tool). These files are important for dependency management and future updates. 

If you need to clear space in the /var/cache/apt/archives directory, you can use the apt clean command. This command clears the local repository of retrieved package files:

```
sudo apt clean
```

Just keep in mind that this will only remove the downloaded package files, not the installed packages themselves.","To safely remove the distfiles located in `/var/cache/apt/archives`, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt clean
```

This command will remove all the packages that are stored in the package cache and no longer needed. It will not remove any packages that are currently installed or needed for any currently installed packages.

After running this command, the distfiles in `/var/cache/apt/archives` will be removed safely."
